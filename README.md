1. Text Classification
Text classification involves categorizing text data into predefined labels or classes. It is widely used in tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization. The steps generally include text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

2. TF-IDF Vectorization
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a technique used to convert text into numerical features. It weighs words based on how frequently they appear in a document (TF) and how important they are across all documents (IDF). This helps to highlight unique and relevant terms.

3. Logistic Regression for Classification
Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective algorithm used for binary and multiclass classification tasks. It models the probability of a text belonging to a particular class based on the input features (in this case, TF-IDF values). It is efficient and works well with high-dimensional sparse data like text.

4. Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.

Classification Report: Provides detailed metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, offering insights into the performance of the model across different classes.
